# Logistic Regresion

The odds ratio = p / (p - 1)

Logit function = log (p / (p - 1))

p( y = 1 | x) conditional probability that aparticular sample belongs to class 1 given its features x.

Now what we are actually interested in is predicting the probability that a certain sample belongs to a particular class
